## Project Overview

Tasty Kitchens is a full-stack food ordering application that allows users to browse restaurants, view menus, add items to their cart, and place orders. The app provides a seamless user experience with features like restaurant filtering, sorting, and a responsive design for both mobile and desktop views. The project is built using React for the frontend, with state management handled through React's built-in state and context APIs. The app integrates with a backend API to fetch restaurant data, menu items, and user ratings.

## Technologies Used :

Frontend: React, React Router, React Icons, React Slick (for carousel), CSS Modules

** State Management **: React State, Context API

**Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

**Styling**: CSS, Media Queries for Responsive Design

**API Integration**: Fetch API for RESTful endpoints

**Local Storage**: Used for cart persistence

**Testing**: React Testing Library (test IDs for components)

## What Can I Do With This Project?

**Users**:

Browse and search for restaurants.

View restaurant details and menus.

Add items to the cart and place orders.

Log in and log out securely.

**Developers**:

Explore a full-stack React application with authentication and API integration.

Learn how to manage state in a React app without external libraries.

Understand responsive design principles and CSS modules.

Implement a cart system using local storage.

Practice writing clean, modular, and reusable components.

**Difficulties and Challenges**

**State Management**:

Managing the state of the cart across different components was challenging. Local storage was used to persist cart data, but syncing it with the UI required careful handling.

**API Integration**:

Fetching data from the backend API and handling loading, success, and error states required robust error handling and state management.

**Responsive Design**:

Ensuring the app looked good on both mobile and desktop devices required extensive use of media queries and CSS adjustments.

**Authentication Flow**:

Implementing JWT-based authentication and protecting routes required a deep understanding of React Router and context API.

**Cart Quantity Management**:

Incrementing and decrementing item quantities in the cart while ensuring the UI updated correctly was tricky.

## **Feature Ideas for Future Enhancements**
